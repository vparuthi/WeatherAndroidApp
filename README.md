# WeatherApp

This is my first attempt at using an API. 
Although the application did not work due to a session timeout I still learned quite a bit throughout this process.
I learned how use it is to create many different classes and organizing them neatly. 
I learned how to implement an API and how to connnect and read data off of a server.  
Specifically learning about: JSONObjects, AsyncTask, and HttpURlConnectiON class.
